Goal: 

You are on the preproduction team for Frostflux Games. Your Creative Lead (Eric McQuiggan) has tasked you with developing preproduction assets for the game. The core theme of the game is homesteading and to teach the public the interconnected nature of small-scale farming. Your creative director will check on your progress. Remember, the less effort you put into preproduction, the harder time you will have once you reach production. You will have weekly check-ins to see how you are progressing.

(unrelated but good testure for blender wood  :)  )


there will be system like tiles 

(brown tiles) farmland

(blue tiles) water 

(red tiles) house 

The player will also need to have a hoe and watering can to till the ground and plant seeds 
seeds will come in bundles of 5x

(tomato seeds will be harvested for 5
tomatos will sell for 5 meaning selling 1 tomato bunch = 25$) 

There will be trees (green tiles around the map you will need an axe to chop the trees down and each tree will give you
3x wood each house will require 10 wood to rebuild each house will give you a bonus on your speed allowing you to move 1extra tile per turn)

during a players turn you can perform 1 movment action and also 1 card action and draw/place action meaning 
if you have no cards left in your hand you draw from the pile of cards if you already have cards in your hand you can place one.

The player will start with 400 100 to buy a hoe 100$ to buy an axe and 100$ to buy a watering can and 100$ left over money to buy seeds 

the shop square is the starying square of the map and starts as purple and is accessable at the begining of the players turn if they wish to visit it (this is not a move simply a choice the player can make at the begining of there turn)




Inside the shop is all purchasable items (as shown below)

***TODO-- NOT REALLY REQUIRED FOR THE GAME JUST AN IDEA 

The player will need to refill there watering can every 10 uses at a water tile

they can also build a well ontop of a water tile for 500$ if they purcahse a well from the townhall (townhall is constructed from having 4 houses side to side so a 2x2 house structure multiblock) it will then become interactable and the player can walk into the Townhall structure to purchase new inworld structures such as the well block allowing the playet to have an increased watering can size from 10 -> 20.

Also giving the player the ability to to purchase Waterwheels to generate power for there farm
